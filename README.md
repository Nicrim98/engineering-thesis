# Testing Algorithms Proposed by Recommendation ITU-T P.1401

Metrics evaluation to compare different QoE objective models.

This repository stores the simulator implementation coded in Python. 
The main script is simulation.py, which coordinates the rest of the scripts.

After cloning this repository and installing missing libraries from requirements.txt, the simulation.py should be run to obtain the results of the metrics' evaluation.

The subjective data can be modified inside the generate_data.py script.
The objective models can be modified inside the objective_models.py script.

For more information about the simulator read the pdf file included in repository.
